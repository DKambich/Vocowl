The idea of Vocowl came about from a simple question, "How do I pick where to eat?" Built using Svelte and utilizing the Google Maps API, Vocowl let's you select nearby restaurants and enter your own favorites then picks one at random. By settling this question, Vocowl is perfect for people who are not vocal or indecisive about their food opinions and pays homage to the wisdom of owls.
